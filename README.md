# MQTT-Security-Labs

Welcome to MQTT-Security-Labs, a hands-on training platform designed to enhance understanding and awareness of security vulnerabilities within MQTT protocols and brokers. This repository includes practical exercises and simulations for four common MQTT attack scenarios.

## Attack Scenarios



1. **Sensible Topic Subscribing and Publishing**
   - This scenario demonstrates how attackers can subscribe to sensitive topics to intercept confidential data or publish malicious data.

2. **Information Grabber from Broker**
   - Explore how attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in MQTT brokers to extract sensitive information, compromising data privacy and integrity.

3. **Credentials Brute Force on Broker Topics**
   - This lab shows how attackers can perform brute force attacks to crack usernames and passwords, gaining unauthorized access to MQTT topics.

4. **Command and Control from Vulnerable Brokers**
   - Learn how compromised MQTT brokers can be used for command and control operations, leading to unauthorized control and manipulation of IoT devices.
